# ECE-Course-Optimization-Guide

If you are reading this document, this is hopefully because you:
* Want to know what courses are or arenâ€™t commonly taken for a concentration
* Are unsure of what courses to prioritize given your interests, and which courses have conflicts with other options
* Want more personal information about a course than is provided in its description or syllabus
* Want to learn about a course, but may not know anyone who has taken it


This is a guide meant to help ECE students at Carnegie Mellon University through their course selection process
